# Meeting 11-4

- Most important is the first meeting. Capture the attention for the 
presentation.
- Why is this important. Why is it not there, and why will it be a reality with 
our tool.
- 'What if you are and entrepeneur and you want to....'
- 'What kind of sources are you going to use and are you going to combine them'.
- We don't need to refer to the project idea document
- Start with the challenge, make logical steps. Don't make jumps.
- Encode text in some way -> make key words stand out.
- WHY did we choose for what we did. Why streaming api. Less time on why we 
did not use others(instagram).
- How did we adapt the technology for our needs.
- Don't spend time in details, but let the audience ask about them.
- Explain concepts by examples!!
- BM25 -> a tweet with link to a sport and one without.
- For everything we show, highlight some stuff that is interesting. What do we 
need people to understand from each slide.
- Precreate insights into understanding what is on the slide. Don't think of 
them on the spot.
- Also for the demo, fietsenwinkel met fietstweets eromheen.
- Use the beweegatlas as a reference for findings.
- Put references in the footnotes.
- Use the review table and be strict.
