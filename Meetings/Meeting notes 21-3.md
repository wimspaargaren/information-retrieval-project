# Taxonomy
- How do you choose the words you use? Because they need to be limited
- Use 'beweegatlas' to define the taxonomies. It will be based upon the 
research that the municipality of Amsterdam did.

# Demo
- You do not want people to be distracted with information that is not 
interesting/necessary.
- They need to understand where they are. Use minimal information to do so.
- Show as much information as possible on top of the map which is created by
our application.
- We need to design polygons to address the delineations to identify the 
neighborhoods. 
- Don't bound the neigborhoods to existing arbitrary boundaries like postal 
codes.

# MaxP
- MaxP algorithm you don't know in advance how many districts you want.
- You are not restricted by the predefined number.
- There are different ways to assign spacial weights. For point data we don't 
have boundaries. We need distance between points. K-nearest neighbors.
- How many K? Find/choose the different options up to 5 which works best.
