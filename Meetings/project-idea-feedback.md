Donâ€™t have to use syllabus as sections only mentions what needs to be mentioned in the document.

Better structure document:

1.	Introduction -> challenges, motivation
2.	Objective -> project idea(stakeholder motivate why), journal?, why is this novel, and why is this relevant to the course
3.	Data collection -> mention sources, Twitter Strava, mention how it is collected <- inside bounding box of amsterdam
4.	Methods -> what type of methods using to analyze data and store data and preprocess data, spatial clustering, flow chart in method section <- mention steps/parts in diagram
5.	Execution plan & specifications
6.	Expected outcomes <- mockup UI, what do we want to do with it
7.	Evaluation and outlook <- possibly talk about stakeholder why they are for our system

Avoid:

* You can do amazing things
* All kind of cool applications
* Nice overview
* Generic stuff
	
Do:

* Use academic language
* Use more tables or diagrams to omit text

Feedback:

* Introduction is weak no motivation, generic stuff
* Goal: not visualize, but detect neighborhoods! Find hidden patterns in the data
* Some of the things mentioned in the relevance could be in the method section.
* Relevance: Only talk about which elements of information retrieval we cover and how do we do that move to method section
* Execution plan: map based interface
