# Meeting 4-4
- Options to define regions yourself since data is scarce
  - Postal code, pc6 or pf4.
  - ...
- Map the points to a polygon, and apply maxp to the polygons.
- [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) cells were used by 
group 16 to apply the algorithm to scarce data.

- For the report it is important to write the steps down that were taken to get 
to the result.
- Clearly explain the approach in our own narrative. Not the general narrative 
of the assignment.

- Maybe apply the threshold to the significance instead of using three points.
- Need a minimum threshold to create a maximum amount of regions.
- Use Amersfoort RD Projection system.
