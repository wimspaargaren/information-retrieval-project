We nowadays track our every move on various social media platforms. 
While it is easy to track individual people, there is a lack of near 
real-time information on sports activities in a certain area. 
The challenge we want to address with our platform is to gather and 
analyze sport activity information and model this onto a map. Our goal 
is to get insight in where a sport activity is more popular and most 
importantly on which time and day of the week. This information is 
interesting for different stakeholders and their respective purposes. 
Individual athletes could use this platform to see when certain areas 
are busy and when they are not and would be suitable to plan their activity. 
For companies the platform can be very useful to see in what neighborhoods 
to build a running or football store for example. Lastly for municipalities 
this information can help in the decision where to build more streetlights 
for runners or which sport parks are most visited and in need of maintenance.
