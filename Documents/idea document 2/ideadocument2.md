# Introduction
Nowadays a lot of (social) data is gathered and available on the internet via mediums like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many more. These platforms are widely used by people to share information to the public. Individual tweets, status posts and photos may not seem usefull, but when a multitude of these tweets, posts and photos are collected, characteristics can be concluded for certain groups of individuals that for example share the same interest. The first challenge is to collect a usefull amount of data and retrieve this latent characteristics. The difficulty is in analyzing, categorizing and grouping data the right way, to be able to extract and come to the right conclusions. Analyzing data can give insights on how people are communicating, what they are are interested about, what motivates and drives them and just general information on what they are doing. 
Since data from the mentioned sources sometimes contains geographic references, it is even possible to identify and define characteristics for certain areas. Another challenge here is spatial analysis and clustering of the collected data.
