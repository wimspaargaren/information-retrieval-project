## Evaluation
In the Section Specifications & Execution Plan a list of MoSCoW specifications was presented.
These specifications are a useful and structured manner to evaluate wether or not the application is working as intended.
The  also describe the importance of each feature.
Each feature can then be checked if they are implemented and how well they are working.
The must haves are the most important features and are the bare minimum for the application to present the findings on the neighborhoods.
The should haves can be inspected on how well they filter and modify the presented data to the user.
How much do they actually give the user?
Lastly the could haves describes the tool to further narrow the target group down.
They can be tested on how easy they are to use and how useful they prove to be.

Besides functional evaluation of the project by the MoSCoW specifications, the project can also be evaluated by testing how well the application performs in different user scenarios.
In Table stakeholder-scenario user scenarios for which Amsterdam In Motion could be used in will be described next to the possible relevant stakeholders.

| Stakeholder         | User Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local government    | The government wants to know in what area of the city there is a need for more streetlights for runners. The government wants to know what area would be most suitable and in need of a new sports complex.  |
| Entrepeneurs        | A company is interested to know where to build their new football/hockey store.                                                                                                                                      |
| Individual athletes | An athlete is looking to plan their exercise. The best would be to do that on a time of a day of the week the park is least busy.                                                                  |

## Outlook
Other similar projects exist that also try to divide a city into neighborhoods based on data collected from social media, an example of this is [LiveHoods](livehoods.org).
Their focus on how they achieve this is different than ours.
LiveHoods uses check-ins to buildings and points of interest (POI's) from the social platform [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com) to identify certain areas of a city.
Using check-ins to buildings and POI's could also possibly be interesting to further expand Amsterdam In Motion.
For example Foursquare could be used to identify important sports complexes around the city.
This could help get a better understanding of why an area is popular for a certain sports activity.
In addition to that a mapping of important sports buildings and POI's can be created.
