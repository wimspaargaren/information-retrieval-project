> ## Evaluation and Success metrics previous document 
> The way we will evaluate the project is going to be based on the MOSCOW definitions. This is a useful and structured listing of the project in which the importance of each feature is represented. The must haves in this list are the bare minimum that should be working at the end of the project. The should haves and the could haves after that are the metrics that are used to further evaluate the success of the project. How well does a feature work and what is the experienced usefulness of a feature. Besides the metrics defined by MOSCOW the project will be evaluated by how well we have reached our goals set in the beginning of the project. These goals can be evaluated by analyzing how well the different stakeholders can use the end product for their respective goals.

## Outlook
