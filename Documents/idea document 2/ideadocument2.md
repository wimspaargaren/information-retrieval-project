  <br><i>Figure mockup-ui: Mockup of the User Interface</i>
</p>
The user is presented with a large map of Amsterdam. On this map blue dots are shown which are tweets or strava activities that are found to be relevant by the algorithm. Relevant posts are posts that fall into a sports activity based on the taxonomy of that sport. Around those posts the neighborhood boxes are drawn in different colors to quickly make clear how the neighborhoods of Amsterdam are divided based on sport activities. Because only relevant tweets are shown this can give an indication to the user how active an area is with regards to sports.

In the setting panel the user can customize what will be shown. This will contain a filter on the type of activity and a filter on when a tweet or activity has taken place. The setting to filter when activities were carried out will give insight in activities that only take place at a certain day of the week or even a certain time of the day. There are also show options which toggle areas or labels.
