## Evaluation
In the section Specifications & Execution Plan a list of MOSCOW Specifications was presented.
These metrics are a useful and structured manner to evaluate wether or not the application is working as intended.
The MOSCOW specifications also describe the importance of each feature.
Each feature can then be checked if they are implemented and how well they are working.
The must haves are the most important features and are the bare minimum for the application to present the findings on the neighborhoods.
The should haves are expanding features on the basic functionality.
They can be inspected on how well they filter and modify the presented data to the user.
The could haves describe extra functionalities that can be implemented after the rest of the application is implemented properly.

Besides functional evaluation of the project by the MOSCOW specifications, the project can also be evaluated by testing how well the application performs in different user scenarios.
In the following table user scenarios for which Amsterdam In Motion could be used in will be described next to the possible relevant stakeholders.

| Stakeholder         | User Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local Government    | - The government wants to know in what area of the city there is a need for more streetlights for runners. - The government wants to know what area would be most suitable and in need of a new sports complex.  |
| Entrepeneurs        | A company wants to know where to build their new football/hockey store.                                                                                                                                          |
| Individual Athletes | An athlete wants to know on what time of a day of the week the park is least busy. This way the athlete can plan their exercise accordingly.                                                                     |
