As mentioned earlier in the objective, the goal of this application is to identify and characterise neighborhoods in Amsterdam. In the following mockup of the user interface(UI) it will become visible how this could look.

</p>
In the UI there is a big map of Amsterdam. On this map blue dots are shown which are tweets or strava activities that are found to be relevant by the algorithm. Around those posts the neighborhood boxes are drawn in different colors to quickly make clear how the neighborhoods of Amsterdam are divided based on sport activities. Because only relevant tweets are shown this can give an indication to the user how active an area is with regards to sports.

In the setting panel the user can customize what will be shown. This will contain a filter on the type of activity and a filter on when a tweet or activity has taken place. The filter on when something was posted will give insight in activities that only take place at a certain day of the week or even a certain time of the day. There are also show options which toggle areas or labels.
